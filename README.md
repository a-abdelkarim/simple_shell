# 0x16. C - Simple Shell

This project is a realization of a command-line shell developed as a Milestone Project for the C programming course at ALX Africa Software Engineering.
The "Gates of Shell" is a project designed during the initial trimester, aimed at providing students with insights into the intricate concepts associated with a shell program, encompassing processes, system calls, bit manipulation, file management, and error handling.
The shell, resembling the basic functionalities of the simple shell (sh) in UNIX, is implemented entirely in the C programming language.


## Features

- Basic shell prompt with customizable prompt string.
- Command execution with support for built-in commands.
- Handling signals (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+, Ctrl+Z).
- Environment variable management.
- Simple error handling and reporting.
